# AQUAire

## Problem statement

Despite clean water being a human necessity, not everyone in the world has access to it; especially those who live or travel to low-income communities. How might we give individuals easy access to locate clean, drinkable water and at their own convenience.

## Summary

AQUAire will help to strengthen communities by providing a credible way for locals to learn about the quality of their water. Community members can submit reviews on water sources in their area, implementing a reliable and self-sustaining platform accessible for those on-the-go.

AQUAire is convenient because it will provide digital mapping features that pinpoints clean water locations and calculates the distance from where you are to where you need to go.

Once upon a time, there was a man named Orlando. One day he decided to take a trip to the Dominican Republic to do some community work, and when he arrived at the local sector called Quita Sueños he was treated with the utmost kindness since he was there to help. The people started giving him food and beverages but he was warned that the water was not safe and could make him sick. This posed a problem: how could he maintain his good health without rejecting the locals kindness? Orlando had no choice but to trust it; however he could never make sure that the water he was drinking safe. He resorted to buying bottled water but it was difficult to find since he was going around from sector to sector trying to help the locals. Orlando's time in the dominican would have been easier if he had accurate information on where to find clean water near him.

## Out of scope - Alejandra

- A volunteer system that lets user volunteer to deliver water 

## UX - Adriana
We chose a small screen to cater to those who need on-the-go access. More people have smart phones over computers, so a smaller screen would be accesible to more people. Because one of our main features is a digital map, it would be more convenient for users to be able to follow direction on their phone.
