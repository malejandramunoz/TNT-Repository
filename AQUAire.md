# AQUAire

## Problem statement

Despite clean water being a human necessity, not everyone in the world has access to it; especially those who live or travel to low-income communities. How might we give individuals easy access to locate clean, drinkable water and at their own convenience.

## Summary

AQUAire will help to strengthen communities by providing a credible way for locals to learn about the quality of their water. Community members can submit reviews on water sources in their area, implementing a reliable and self-sustaining platform accessible for those on-the-go.

AQUAire is convenient because it will provide digital mapping features that pinpoints clean water locations and calculates the distance from where you are to where you need to go.

Once upon a time, there was a man named Orlando. One day he decided to take a trip to the Dominican Republic to do some community work, and when he arrived at the local sector called Quita Sue√±os he was treated with the utmost kindness since he was there to help. The people started giving him food and beverages but he was warned that the water was not safe and could make him sick. This posed a problem: how could he maintain his good health without rejecting the locals kindness? Orlando had no choice but to trust it; however he could never make sure that the water he was drinking was safe. He resorted to buying bottled water but it was difficult to find since he was going around from sector to sector trying to help the locals. Orlando's time in the Dominican Republic would have been easier if he had accurate information on where to find clean water near him.


## Goals - Andi

*What are you improving in the customers life*

Our app will save customers time with digital mapping to help marrow down thier search for finding locations with clean water and allows a quick and easy way to do so. It will provide comfort from credible customer reviews, secure feedback in real time, and options to fit bugget needs. Finally, our app will educate customers and expand thier knowledge on the importance of consumiung clean water, what drinking unlean water can do to your health and the tools and techniques to help you clean your own water.


*How can it be measured*

By allowing submissions from cutomers to be reviewed to make sure they trustworthy and scoping to see if sources for loactions are sill functional and reliable. This could also be meansured by having a team of volunteers find these locations and test the water themselves.

## In scope - Alejandra

- Tracking of the water consumed and statistics based on this data.
- Delivery system based on being able to purchase water from water locations near the user.

## UX - Adriana
We chose a small screen to cater to those who need on-the-go access. More people have smart phones over computers, so a smaller screen would be accesible to more people. Because one of our main features is a digital map, it would be more convenient for users to be able to follow direction on their phone.
*Screenshots of feature UI design and descriptions, including why large or small screen*

The user is introduced to our mobile web app with clear options and a friendly user interface. The header is simple: it gives a clear display of the name of our app, and links to a menu that leads to all of the app's feature, to prevent overwhelming the user with information. 

We wanted to showcase all of the app's features on our home page without cluttering the visual experience of the user. To prevent this, we added a slideshow/carousel that automatically switches every 5 seconds. The photo on the screen would be descriptive of the feature it links to.

The bottom of our web page allows for the user to change the language of the app. Because we want our app to be accessible to communities all around the world, and access to clean water is a global issue, it is important for our app to be linguistically diverse. This option is repeated on the majority of our pages.

This is the side menu that appears when the user clicks on the "Hamburger menu" on the home page. It displays all the features of the app in one short menu, with a description tab also enabled when the user clicks on the carrot icon, giving the user more information on that specific feature.

![Menu Page](PrototypeImages/morePage.png)
  
The maps feature of our app presents the user with a map pinpointing the locations of local clean water sources. If they are not logged into an account (where they have to provide their address) they will have the option to search for a location. This clear display of the map will allow users to immediately and easily locate clean water in their area.

Below the map, their nearest local water sources will display, in order of closest to farthest vicinity. The name of the location will appear above the picture, and its "star rating" will appear below it. Pictures of the water will display, so that the user knows what options they have as they scroll. 

There will be a button to add  a review at the top of the page so that the user does not have to scroll through all their local areas if they just want to quickly leave a review. 

![Map Page](PrototypeImages/maps.png)
 
Knowing our space is limited on the mobile device, the Create a Review page requests four simple inputs of the user: A picture of the water, the location, their review, and their overall star rating. 

We wanted to give the user a simple and efficient experience when leaving a review by displaying a clear and short form. They will be able to easily upload a picture from their camera roll when they click on the image box, and select a rating by tapping on the stars to increase the rating. A gray star signifies that it has not been tapped, and all stars will be gray by default. When tapped on they will turn yellow and the most recent star they tapped on will be outlined with a blue stroke. This will allow for a users to easily know what they are tapping on, which is important because of the small mobile screen.

![Leave a Review Page](PrototypeImages/createReview.png)

This page will present the user with a compiled slideshow of pictures of the water, an "Overall Quality" that is measured upon ratings, it's star rating, and all the reviews that have been left by users. This display allows the user to quickly find the information they need.

All reviews will state the name of the user who submitted it, to support a community of truth, allowing users to report those who spread misinformation untracked by the app.

![Reviewed Water Page](PrototypeImages/reviewedPage.png)
  
The My Account page displays all the information stored of the user in our web app. It shows their profile picture up top, followed by their information. We designed this page to be non-scrolling so users can input their information without being overwhelmed by the length of the page. 

By putting all this information in one place, it allows for the user to feel secure about their privacy because they can access it quickly at any time.

From the summery of the competitive analysis, the primary strenghts, weaknesses, oportunities and threats of AQUAire are:

Strenghts: 
- Map feature that is real time.
- Specific places where you can find water and not just rivers or the sea/
- Downloadable map to use offline.
- Social media outreach.

Weaknesses:
- The information elsewhere could be better than ours because we are just compailing it now, and the fact that it could be less accurate.
- More time in the business in general
- Credibility that we would have to build.
- Resources to information that we don't have

Oportunities:
- Focused on accesibility. Not building water sources for the community.
- Lack of getting input from the community and those who travel there.
- Targetting people all over the world, not just specific areas/communities.
- There's not much travel needed for the dev team.

Threats: 
- Copyright in general
- Getting the information to our app, it could be that we would need to source our competitors.
- Financial difficulties, being in an early stage company development.



## Future opportunities - Dickson

*What would be built next? What are ways to expand customer reach?*

Expanding target market:
-	Aquaire‚Äôs initial release will include two languages and because of limited resources, will be rolled-out in a few countries.
-	As we grow and get more revenue, Aquaire hopes to expand by supporting more languages and expanding to more countries. We hope to expand our user numbers by targeting remote communities directly. We could recruit community partners who would oversee recruiting new member and verifying the credibility of water sources.
New features:

-	Initially, our apps main features will be maps showing closest clean water points, reviews, and information. Future releases could include wellness features such as tracking the amount of water consumed by an individual per day, or environmental features such as tracking the amount of water wasted.
-	We could also add a donation feature to allow users of our app to donate to clean water projects directly through our app.
-	Other features such as delivery could be rolled out depending on the feedback we get from our users, and once users have understood the core purpose of our app.
Revenue model:

-	Because our app mainly targets low-income communities, our revenue model will not be driven by subscriptions. 
-	Acquire will be valuable to clean water vendors and NGOs. Clean water vendors can utilize user data to provide targeted ads, while non-profits can use data on our app to know which areas need new projects.
